# Bank Churn Analysis (Data Preparation and EDA)

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing customer churn data from a retail bank. The goal was to prepare a messy dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and engineer meaningful features for predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Prepare messy Excel and CSV data for analysis
- Handle missing values and inconsistent labels
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer new features such as balance-to-salary ratio
- Visualize churn patterns across demographics and behavior

## 📁 Files Included

- `Bank_Churn.csv`: Cleaned version of the dataset
- `Bank_Churn_Data_Dictionary.csv`: Descriptions of all columns in the dataset
- `Bank_Churn_Messy.xlsx`: Raw Excel file with original messy data
- `Bank_Churn_Analysis.ipynb`: Full notebook with data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering
- `Bank_Churn_Analysis.pdf`: Exported PDF version of the notebook
- `featured-image.png`: Banner image for visual presentation

## 📊 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 💡 Key Insights

- Customers with fewer products or inactive accounts were more likely to churn
- Geography and balance-to-salary ratio showed strong correlation with churn
- Cleaned, transformed dataset is now ready for predictive modeling (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
